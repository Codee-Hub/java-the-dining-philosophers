# Dining Philosophers

The Dining Philosophers problem, proposed by Dijkstra in 1965, serves as a synchronization challenge. Since then, numerous synchronization algorithms have been either related to or tested against the Dining Philosophers problem.

## Problem Definition

It's important to note that this is merely an analogy. In this scenario, each philosopher alternates between two tasks: eating and thinking. When a philosopher becomes hungry, they attempt to pick up the forks to their left and right, one at a time, regardless of order. If successful in acquiring both forks, they eat for a certain period and then return the forks to the table, thereafter resuming thinking.

By definition, the problem at hand is:

Are you able to propose an algorithm that implements each philosopher in such a way that they can execute the tasks of eating and thinking without ever becoming deadlocked?
